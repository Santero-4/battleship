ABOUT:
This is just like any other battleship game, except there are characters as your opponent. Each difficulty level has a different opponent, with a different special attack and even dialouge.
When you win, you can compare your score to the leaderboard which is currently populated by the scores of my real playtesters (names changed for privacy)!
